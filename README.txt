-	Description for each part

part1
Our result almost satisfies the expectation. The only difference is that the occupation of the real time process is close to 100% instead exact 100%.

The description should indicate whether your solution for the part is working
or not. You may also want to include anything else you would like to
communicate to the grader, such as extra functionality you implemented or how
you tried to fix your non-working code.
