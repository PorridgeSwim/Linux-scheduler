This file should contain:

-	Your name & UNI (or those of all group members for group assignments)
-	Homework assignment number
-	Description for each part

The description should indicate whether your solution for the part is working
or not. You may also want to include anything else you would like to
communicate to the grader, such as extra functionality you implemented or how
you tried to fix your non-working code.
